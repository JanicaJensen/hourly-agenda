# Hourly Agenda - Week 5 challenge (workday scheduler)

## What is it?

This is a page that allows the user to log information such as events, reminders, etc. into a time slot throughout the 9-5 workday.

## Setup

The page has a very accessible layout that includes 3 columns, one with an hour time-slot, an input section for text, and a save icon button. The different colors in the text-input areas represent the current, past, and future times. 

## Usage
The live URL can be found here: https://janicajensen.github.io/hourly-agenda/
In order to use, a user must locate the time slot visually, then click into the text-input area to the right of the time. Once satisfied with their entry, they may click the save icon to the right of the textbox. The app will hold on to all information until it is deleted from local storage or otherwise erased within the text input and re-saved. As the hours pass, the user should see the color in the text-input boxes change color to indicate the current, past, and future events. 

## Errors and Bugs

There are no bugs that I have encountered thus far. 


## Team

The starter code was provided by EdEx and U of U bootcamp and the additional javascript and styling was by me.
